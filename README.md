# Math Bot CLI
GUI out in Fall 2024

I plan on expanding this for more than math

Currently Attempting to Adapt to Semantic Versioning.

## Notes
**Since I wrote it, I thought I should attach a GNU license and upload it here.**

(This Project is going to change a lot, I'm adding a lot of math functions to this)

### Usage: (Updated as of V3.1.0)
  
  --about, -info, -a: Show About info
  
  --credits, -c: Credits
