# Math Bot CLI
GUI out in Fall 2024

I plan on expanding this for more than math

Currently Attempting to Adapt to Semantic Versioning.

## Notes
**Since I wrote it, I thought I should attach a GNU license and upload it here.**

(This Project is going to change a lot, I'm adding a lot of math functions to this)

Version 2 Has Been Skipped Due To Issues.

### Usage: (Updated as of V3.0.2)
 
  --about --info -a: Show About info
  
  --help, -h: Show help
  
  --prime (number): Check if a number is a prime number

Example: ./MathBotCLI (Operation) (Number)

**Build From Source Instructions Will Be Here By 2024**

**V3.1 Should Be Here By December 2023**
