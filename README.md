This used to be a simple test app for IT to see if Daniel McGuire Corporationâ€™s computers were okay.
## Notes
**Since I wrote it, I thought I should attach a GNU license and upload it here.**

(This Project is going to change a lot, I'm adding a lot of math functions to this)

Version 2 Has Been Skipped Due To Issues.

### Usage: (Updated as of V3.0.1)

***PLEASE NOTE I AM STILL LEARNING C# (The Programming Language for this project)***
